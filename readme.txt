UPDATING THIS WHOLE WEBSITE TO BE MOBILE FRIENDLY AND HAVE SCRIPT FOR UI CREATION.

This is just a fun website that I made as a practice.
I was just browsing the web and suddenly found a website 
that indeed looked like a PC. I was hooked and then i made this.

## ICONS

Free icons from: https://www.flaticon.com/ 
Free icons from: https://icons8.com/icons 
Free icons from: https://www.iconfinder.com/
I believe I got all the icons from these websites most of it was from a pack. If i found which one, i'll post a link in here.

## Sounds

Free Mouse Click Sounds from: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download/mouse-click-2
Free shutdown/startup sound: https://freesound.org/people/supersnd/sounds/331422/ https://freesound.org/people/supersnd/sounds/331425/   thanks too "supersnd" .
Audacity: https://www.audacityteam.org/

```bash
(Edited the Mouse Click Sounds with Audacity to make it not really loud and soft (bass and tremble it down))
```
